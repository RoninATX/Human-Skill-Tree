"""graphscout.py - NetworkX scouting harness.

Premise under test: when the data already lives in JSON / markdown / a dataframe,
how far does NetworkX get you before you actually need a graph database?

Two corpora, one analysis engine:

  beans  - every .beans repo in the workspace (work + personal), using both the
           DECLARED edges the tracker knows about (parent, blockedBy) and the
           IMPLICIT edges it does not (one bean's prose naming another bean's id,
           including across repo boundaries, which the tracker cannot represent
           at all).
  notes  - any folder of markdown, linked by [[wikilinks]] and relative .md
           links (Obsidian vault, .know, a repo wiki).

Usage:
    python graphscout.py beans
    python graphscout.py beans --repos ProjectOne project-two --json out.json
    python graphscout.py notes --root "/path/to/a/markdown/vault"
    python graphscout.py beans --png beans.png
    python graphscout.py context <bean-id|doc-stem>
    python graphscout.py rot                    # dead ids cited by beans AND docs

Requires: networkx (>=3.x). matplotlib only for --png.

      the sibling-wiki case forces, from the opposite direction: corpus that lives
      OUTSIDE seg_root. Two unrelated reasons, one test.)
    * **Inside the segment but not a doc node** -- e.g. a prompt template that
      shares a basename with a knowledge file (`forge/identity/templates/
      capabilities.md` vs `.know/capabilities.md`).

    A ref naming nothing real is NOT out-of-corpus: a bare `foo.md` still needs
    the stem fallback, which is load-bearing. The test is "names something real
    that isn't ours", never "path resolution failed".

    Deliberately ONE test rather than a containment check plus an identity check.
    An earlier version also refused anything resolving outside the segment root,
    which looked stricter and was simply wrong: the sibling `<repo>.wiki` is part
    of the corpus but lives OUTSIDE that root, so every wiki-relative ref was
    refused and four genuine wiki→knowledge edges vanished. Membership in

    a bare stem it is unambiguous by construction and never needs the

    CALLER ASSUMPTION: `seg_root` is computed as `WORKSPACE / repo`, i.e. the

    install and not for a **root-as-segment** one, where the workspace root *is*
    the segment and `WORKSPACE / repo` names a directory that does not exist. The
    failure is silent rather than loud -- the citing-doc leg still resolves, so
    the segment-root leg just quietly matches nothing and root-relative refs stop
    forming edges. A root-as-segment install should route this through its own
    `segment_path()` (as a root-as-segment install must) rather than passing
    `WORKSPACE / repo` in.
